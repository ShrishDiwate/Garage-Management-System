# Garage-Management-System
Problem Statement:

Traditional garage and vehicle service center operations heavily rely on manual processes for appointment booking, service tracking, in
ventory management, billing, and customer communication.
This manual approach leads to several challenges, including:
•	Inefficient Service Scheduling: Missed appointments and delays due to lack of automated reminders and scheduling conflicts.
•	Poor Customer Engagement: No real-time updates or easy access for customers to view service history or book appointments.
•	Inventory Mismanagement: Frequent stockouts or overstocking due to lack of real-time inventory tracking and alerts.
•	Data Inaccuracy: Increased risk of errors in service records, billing, and customer details due to manual data entry.
•	Limited Reporting and Insights: Difficulty in analyzing service performance, customer satisfaction, and revenue trends due to absence of real-time dashboards and reports.
•	Slow Billing Process: Manual invoice generation delays the billing and payment process, affecting revenue flow.
•	Inconsistent Customer Feedback Management: Lack of a structured system for gathering and acting on customer feedback and complaints.
